            <h1>Ch11: Further Functions.</h1>
            <h2>Function Properties and Methods</h2>
            <p>
                Functions have built-in properties such as <b>length</b>, but can have custom properties added.
            </p>
            <h2>Call and Apply Methods</h2>
            <p>
                All functions have <b>call()</b> and <b>apply()</b> methods that can invoke a function with
                the value of <b>this</b> bound to an object that is provided as an argument.
            </p>
            <h2>Memoization</h2>
            <p>
                If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a <b>cache</b>
                property. Then if the same argument is used again later, we can return the value from the
                cache, rather than having to compute the result again.
            </p>
            <h2>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h2>
            <p>
                Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that are enclosed in
                parentheses and immediately followed by double parentheses so they're invoked.
                They are useful for namespacing variables and setting default values.
            </p>
            <h2>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h2>
            <p>
                Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function,
                depending on certain conditions. If any properties have previously been set on
                the function, these will be lost when the function redefines itself.
            </p>
            <h2>Recursive Functions</h2>
            <p>
                A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.
            </p>
            <h2>Callbacks</h2>
            <p>
                A callback is a function that's provided as an argument to another function.
            </p>
            <p>
                Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop.
                This means that a program can continue to run in a single thread while waiting for
                another task to be completed.
            </p>
            <h2>Promises</h2>
            <p>
                Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions
                in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors.
            </p>
            <h2>Functions That Return Functions</h2>
            <p>
                Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.
            </p>
            <h2>Closures</h2>
            <p>
                A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the
                scope of the function it was originally defined in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever a function is defined inside another function, the inner function
                will have access to any variables that are declared in the outer function's scope.
            </p>
            <h2>Generators</h2>
            <p>
                A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the <b>function</b>keyword.
            </p>
            <p>
                A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a <b>next()</b> method,
                which returns the next value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.
            </p>
            <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied
                as a series of functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Functional programming is a programming paradigm. Other examples of programming paradigms
                include object oriented programming and procedural programming. JavaScript is a
                multi-paradigm language, meaning that it can be used to program in a variety of
                paradigms.
            </p>
            <h2>Pure Functions</h2>
            <p>
                Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called
                from, have no side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same
                arguments (referential transparency).
            </p>
            <h2>Currying</h2>
            <p>
                Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a
                function. A new function is returned until all the arguments have been used.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Ch13: AJAX.</h1>
            <h2>AJAX</h2>
            <p>
                Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.
            </p>
            <h2>The Fetch API</h2>
            <p>
                Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.
            </p>
            <h2>Response Interface</h2>
            <p>
                The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request
                or to create your own response objects.
            </p>
            <h2>Request Interface</h2>
            <p>
                The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains
                information about the request being made, such as the URL and headers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.
            </p>
            <h2>Headers Interface</h2>
            <p>
                The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added
                to a request or response object.
            </p>
            <h2>FormData</h2>
            <p>
                The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.
            </p>
