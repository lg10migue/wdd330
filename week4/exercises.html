            <h2>A Vector Type</h2>
            <p>
                Write a class Vec that represents a vector in two-dimensional space. It takes
                x and y parameters (numbers), which it should save to properties of the same
                name.
            </p>
            <p>
                Give the Vec prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take another
                vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or difference
                of the two vectors' (this and the parameter) x and y values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add a getter property length to the prototype that computes the length of
                the vector—that is, the distance of the point (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).
            </p>
            <h2>Groups</h2>
            <p>
                The standard JavaScript environment provides another data structure called
                Set. Like an instance of Map, a set holds a collection of values. Unlike Map, it
                does not associate other values with those—it just tracks which values are part
                of the set. A value can be part of a set only once—adding it again doesn't have
                any effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set, it has add,
                delete, and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds
                a value to the group (but only if it isn't already a member), delete removes
                its argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean
                value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf, to determine
                whether two values are the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as argument
                and creates a group that contains all the values produced by iterating over it.
            </p>
            <h2>Iterable Groups</h2>
            <p>
                Make the Group class from the previous exercise iterable. Refer to the section
                about the iterator interface earlier in the chapter if you aren't clear on the
                exact form of the interface anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you used an array to represent the group's members, don't just return the
                iterator created by calling the Symbol.iterator method on the array. That
                would work, but it defeats the purpose of this exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is okay if your iterator behaves strangely when the group is modified during
                iteration.                
            </p>
            <h2>Borrowing a Method</h2>
            <p>
                Earlier in the chapter I mentioned that an object's hasOwnProperty can be
                used as a more robust alternative to the in operator when you want to ignore
                the prototype's properties. But what if your map needs to include the word
                "hasOwnProperty"? You won't be able to call that method anymore because
                the object's own property hides the method value.
            </p>
            <p>
                Can you think of a way to call hasOwnProperty on an object that has its own
                property by that name?
            </p>
