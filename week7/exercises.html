            <h1>Ch5: Higher-Order Functions</h1>
            <h2>Flattening</h2>
            <p>
                Use the reduce method in combination with the concat method to “flatten”
                an array of arrays into a single array that has all the elements of the original
                arrays.
            </p>
            <h2>Your Own Loop</h2>
            <p>
                Write a higher-order function loop that provides something like a for loop
                statement. It takes a value, a test function, an update function, and a body
                function. Each iteration, it first runs the test function on the current loop value
                and stops if that returns false. Then it calls the body function, giving it the
                current value. Finally, it calls the update function to create a new value and
                starts from the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
                When defining the function, you can use a regular loop to do the actual
                looping.
            </p>
            <h2>Everything</h2>
            <p>
                Analogous to the some method, arrays also have an every method. This one
                returns true when the given function returns true for every element in the array.
                In a way, some is a version of the || operator that acts on arrays, and every is
                like the && operator.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implement every as a function that takes an array and a predicate function
                as parameters. Write two versions, one using a loop and one using the some
                method.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Ch18: HTTP and Forms</h1>
            <h2>Content Negotiation</h2>
            <p>
                One of the things HTTP can do is called content negotiation. The Accept
                request header is used to tell the server what type of document the client
                would like to get. Many servers ignore this header, but when a server knows of
                various ways to encode a resource, it can look at this header and send the one
                that the client prefers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The URL https://eloquentjavascript.net/author is configured to respond with
                either plaintext, HTML, or JSON, depending on what the client asks for. These
                formats are identified by the standardized media types text/plain, text/html,
                and application/json.
            </p>
            <p>
                Send requests to fetch all three formats of this resource. Use the headers
                property in the options object passed to fetch to set the header named Accept
                to the desired media type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, try asking for the media type application/rainbows+unicorns and
                see which status code that produces.
            </p>
            <h2>A JavaScript Workbench</h2>
            <p>
                Build an interface that allows people to type and run pieces of JavaScript code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Put a button next to a &lttextarea&gt field that, when pressed, uses the Function
                constructor we saw in Chapter 10 to wrap the text in a function and call it.
                Convert the return value of the function, or any error it raises, to a string and
                display it below the text field.
            </p>

            <h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
            <p>
                Conway's Game of Life is a simple simulation that creates artificial “life” on
                a grid, each cell of which is either alive or not. Each generation (turn), the
                following rules are applied:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbors dies.</li>
                <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation</li>
                <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A neighbor is defined as any adjacent cell, including diagonally adjacent ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that these rules are applied to the whole grid at once, not one square
                at a time. That means the counting of neighbors is based on the situation at
                the start of the generation, and changes happening to neighbor cells during this
                generation should not influence the new state of a given cell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implement this game using whichever data structure you find appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use Math.random to populate the grid with a random pattern initially. Display
                it as a grid of checkbox fields, with a button next to it to advance to the next
                generation. When the user checks or unchecks the checkboxes, their changes
                should be included when computing the next generation.
            </p>
