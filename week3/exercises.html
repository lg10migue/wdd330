            <h1>Ch14: The Document Object Model</h1>
            <h2>Build A Table</h2>
            <p>
                An HTML table is built with the following tag structure:
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    &lttable&gt
                        &lttr&gt
                        &ltth&gtname&lt/th&gt
                        &ltth&gtheight&lt/th&gt
                        &ltth&gtplace&lt/th&gt
                        &lt/tr&gt
                        &lttr&gt
                        &lttd&gtKilimanjaro&lt/td&gt
                        &lttd&gt5895&lt/td&gt
                        &lttd&gtTanzania&lt/td&gt
                        &lt/tr&gt
                    &lt/table&gt
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                For each row, the  &lttable&gt tag contains a  &lttr&gt tag. Inside of these  &lttr&gt tags,
                we can put cell elements: either heading cells ( &ltth&gt) or regular cells ( &lttd&gt).                    
            </p>
            <p>
                Given a data set of mountains, an array of objects with name, height, and
                place properties, generate the DOM structure for a table that enumerates the
                objects. It should have one column per key and one row per object, plus a
                header row with &ltth&gt elements at the top, listing the column names.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write this so that the columns are automatically derived from the objects,
                by taking the property names of the first object in the data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Add the resulting table to the element with an id attribute of "mountains"
                so that it becomes visible in the document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have this working, right-align cells that contain number values by
                setting their style.textAlign property to "right".
            </p>
            <section>
                <h1>Mountains</h1>
                <div id="mountains"></div>
            </section>
            <h2>Elements By Tag Name</h2>
            <p>
                The document.getElementsByTagName method returns all child elements with a
                given tag name. Implement your own version of this as a function that takes a
                node and a string (the tag name) as arguments and returns an array containing
                all descendant element nodes with the given tag name.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find the tag name of an element, use its nodeName property. But note
                that this will return the tag name in all uppercase. Use the toLowerCase or
                toUpperCase string methods to compensate for this.
            </p>
            <section>
                <h3>Heading with a <span>span</span> element.</h3>
                <p id="paragr">
                    A paragraph with <span>one</span>, <span>two</span>
                    spans.
                </p>
            </section>
            <h2>The Cat's Hat</h2>
            <p>
                Extend the cat animation defined earlier so that both the cat and his hat
                (&ltimg src="img/hat.png"&gt) orbit at opposite sides of the ellipse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Or make the hat circle around the cat. Or alter the animation in some other
                interesting way.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make positioning multiple objects easier, it is probably a good idea to
                switch to absolute positioning. This means that top and left are counted
                relative to the top left of the document. To avoid using negative coordinates,
                which would cause the image to move outside of the visible page, you can add
                a fixed number of pixels to the position values.                
            </p>
            <button id="animation">Animate!</button>
            <section style="min-height: 200px ; position: relative ;">
                <img src="images/cat.png" id="cat" style="position: absolute ;" alt="cat">
                <img src="images/hat.png" id="hat" style="position: absolute ;" alt="hat" >
            </section>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Ch15: Handling Events</h1>
            <h2>Balloon</h2>
            <p>
                Write a page that displays a balloon (using the balloon emoji, üéà). When you
                press the up arrow, it should inflate (grow) 10 percent, and when you press the
                down arrow, it should deflate (shrink) 10 percent.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can control the size of text (emoji are text) by setting the font-size
                CSS property (style.fontSize) on its parent element. Remember to include a
                unit in the value‚Äîfor example, pixels (10px).
            </p>
            <p>
                The key names of the arrow keys are "ArrowUp" and "ArrowDown". Make
                sure the keys change only the balloon, without scrolling the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                When that works, add a feature where, if you blow up the balloon past a
                certain size, it explodes. In this case, exploding means that it is replaced with
                an üí• emoji, and the event handler is removed (so that you can‚Äôt inflate or
                deflate the explosion).
            </p>

            <h2>Mouse Trial</h2>
            <p>
                In JavaScript‚Äôs early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages with
                lots of animated images, people came up with some truly inspiring ways to use
                the language.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of these was the mouse trail‚Äîa series of elements that would follow the
                mouse pointer as you moved it across the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely
                positioned &ltdiv&gt elements with a fixed size and background color (refer to the
                code in the ‚ÄúMouse Clicks‚Äù section for an example). Create a bunch of such
                elements and, when the mouse moves, display them in the wake of the mouse
                pointer.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution as
                simple or as complex as you want. A simple solution to start with is to keep
                a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving the next one
                to the mouse‚Äôs current position every time a "mousemove" event occurs.                
            </p>
            <h2>Tabs</h2>
            <p>
                Tabbed panels are widely used in user interfaces. They allow you to select
                an interface panel by choosing from a number of tabs ‚Äústicking out‚Äù above an
                element.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this exercise you must implement a simple tabbed interface. Write a function, asTabs, that takes a DOM node and creates a tabbed interface showing
                the child elements of that node. It should insert a list of &ltbutton&gt elements at
                the top of the node, one for each child element, containing text retrieved from
                the data-tabname attribute of the child. All but one of the original children
                should be hidden (given a display style of none). The currently visible node
                can be selected by clicking the buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
                When that works, extend it to style the button for the currently selected
                tab differently so that it is obvious which tab is selected.
            </p>
            <tab-panel>
                <div data-tabname="one">Tab one</div>
                <div data-tabname="two">Tab two</div>
                <div data-tabname="three">Tab three</div>
            </tab-panel>
        </div>
