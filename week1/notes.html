            <h1>LocalStorage</h1>
            <p>Web storage objects <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> allow to save key/value pairs in the browser.</p>
            <p>What’s interesting about them is that the data survives a page refresh (for <code>sessionStorage</code>) and even a full browser restart (for <code>localStorage</code>). We’ll see that very soon.</p>
            <p>We already have cookies. Why additional objects?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlike cookies, web storage objects are not sent to server with each request. Because of that, we can store much more. Most modern browsers allow at least 5 megabytes of data (or more) and have settings to configure that.</li>
                <li>Also unlike cookies, the server can’t manipulate storage objects via HTTP headers. Everything’s done in JavaScript.</li>
                <li>The storage is bound to the origin (domain/protocol/port triplet). That is, different protocols or subdomains infer different storage objects, they can’t access data from each other.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both storage objects provide same methods and properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>setItem(key, value)</code> – store key/value pair.</li>
                <li><code>getItem(key)</code> – get the value by key.</li>
                <li><code>removeItem(key)</code> – remove the key with its value.</li>
                <li><code>clear()</code> – delete everything.</li>
                <li><code>key(index)</code> – get the key on a given position.</li>
                <li><code>length</code> – the number of stored items.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Master Mobile UX</h1>
            <p>These are some of the things that we have to take into account to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We have to understand that the mobile device business is growing remarkably, even above desktop computers and laptops.</li>
                <li>To create better designs, we must first understand users and give them what they need.</li>
                <li>We must create better mobile layouts with strategic menu designs.</li>
                <li>We have to design intuitive and mobile friendly forms.</li>
                <li>Last but not least, you have to design better mobile advertising user experience.</li>
            </ul>
