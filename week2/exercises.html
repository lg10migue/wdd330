            <h1>Ch2: Program Structure</h1>
            <h2>Looping A Triangle</h2>
            <p>
                Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    #
                    ##
                    ###
                    ####
                    #####
                    ######
                    #######
                </pre>
            </p>
            <h2>FizzBuzz</h2>
            <p>
                Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,
                with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
                number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
                When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for
                numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz"
                for numbers divisible by only one of those).
            </p>
            <h2>ChessBoard</h2>
            <p>
                Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline
                characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
                or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard. Passing this string to
                console.log should show something like this:
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    # # # #
                    # # # # 
                    # # # #
                    # # # # 
                    # # # #
                    # # # # 
                    # # # #
                    # # # # 
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
                = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid
                of the given width and height.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Ch3: Functions</h1>
            <h2>Minimum</h2>
            <p>
                The previous chapter introduced the standard function Math.min that returns
                its smallest argument. We can build something like that now. Write a function
                min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

            </p>
            <h2>Recursion</h2>
            <p>
                We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a
                number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s
                another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zero is even.</li>
                <li>One is odd.</li>
                <li>For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The
                function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return
                a Boolean.
                Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a
                way to fix this?

            </p>
            <h2>Bean Counting</h2>
            <p>
                You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string"[N].
                The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example,
                "b"). The first character has position 0, which causes the last one to be found at
                position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length
                2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns
                a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the
                string. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except
                it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted
                (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to
                make use of this new function.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Ch4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays</h1>
            <h2>The Sum of a Range</h2>
            <p>
                The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to compute
                the sum of a range of numbers: <br><br> console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns
                an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the
                sum of these numbers. Run the example program and see whether it does
                indeed return 55.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a bonus assignment, modify your range function to take an optional third
                argument that indicates the “step” value used when building the array. If no
                step is given, the elements go up by increments of one, corresponding to the
                old behavior. The function call range(1, 10, 2) should return [1, 3, 5, 7,
                9]. Make sure it also works with negative step values so that range(5, 2, -1)
                produces [5, 4, 3, 2].
            </p>
            <h2>Reversing an Array</h2>
            <p>
                Arrays have a reverse method that changes the array by inverting the order in
                which its elements appear. For this exercise, write two functions, reverseArray
                and reverseArrayInPlace. The first, reverseArray, takes an array as argument
                and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order. The
                second, reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: it modifies
                the array given as argument by reversing its elements. Neither may use the
                standard reverse method.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking back to the notes about side effects and pure functions in the
                previous chapter, which variant do you expect to be useful in more situations?
                Which one runs faster?
            </p>
            <h2>A List</h2>
            <p>
                Objects, as generic blobs of values, can be used to build all sorts of data structures.
                A common data structure is the list (not to be confused with array). A list is a nested
                set of objects, with the first object holding a reference to the second, the second to
                the third, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    let list = {
                        value: 1,
                        rest: {
                            value: 2,
                            rest: {
                                value: 3,
                                rest: null
                            }
                        }
                    };                    
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                A nice thing about lists is that they can share parts of their structure. For
                example, if I create two new values {value: 0, rest: list} and {value: -1,
                rest: list} (with list referring to the binding defined earlier), they are both
                independent lists, but they share the structure that makes up their last three
                elements. The original list is also still a valid three-element list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a function arrayToList that builds up a list structure like the one
                shown when given [1, 2, 3] as argument. Also write a listToArray function
                that produces an array from a list. Then add a helper function prepend, which
                takes an element and a list and creates a new list that adds the element to the
                front of the input list, and nth, which takes a list and a number and returns
                the element at the given position in the list (with zero referring to the first
                element) or undefined when there is no such element.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you haven’t already, also write a recursive version of nth.
            </p>
            <h2>Deep Comparison</h2>
            <p>
                The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes you’d prefer to
                compare the values of their actual properties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write a function deepEqual that takes two values and returns true only if they
                are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the values
                of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find out whether values should be compared directly (use the === operator
                for that) or have their properties compared, you can use the typeof operator.
                If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a deep comparison.
                But you have to take one silly exception into account: because of a historical
                accident, typeof null also produces "object".
            </p>
            <p>
                The Object.keys function will be useful when you need to go over the properties of
                objects to compare them.
