            <h2>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Bugs</b> are unavoidable in code, and it's best to find them early rather than later.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Errors</b> are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused
                by one of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    System error ― there's a problem with the system or external devices with which
                    the program is interacting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it
                    could even be as simple as a typo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is
                    unable to handle.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                An <b>exception</b> is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by
                the program to deal with the error.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <b>warning</b> can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause
                the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.
            </p>
            <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string <b>"use strict"</b>. This can
                be used in a whole file or just a single function.
            </p>
            <h2>Linting Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.
            </p>
            <h2>Feature Detection</h2>
            <p>
                Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it,
                helping to avoid an exception being thrown.
            </p>
            <h2>Debugging in the Browser</h2>
            <p>
                Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and
                then dealing with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The console and browser's built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively
                find and fix bugs in code.
            </p>
            <h2>Error Objects</h2>
            <p>
                An error object is created when an exception occurs.
            </p>
            <h2>Throwing Exceptions</h2>
            <p>
                Exceptions can be thrown using the <b>throw</b> statement.
            </p>
            <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
            <p>
                Any code placed inside a <b>try</b> block will pass any error objects to a <b>catch</b>
                block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a <b>finally</b> block will run
                if an exception does or does not occur.
            </p>
            <h2>Tests</h2>
            <p>
                Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good
                tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.
            </p>
            <h2>Test-driven Development</h2>
            <p>
                Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing
                the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new
                feature is implemented.
            </p>
            <h2>Jest</h2>
            <p>
                The Jest framework can be used to test code.
            </p>
