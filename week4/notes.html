            <h1>Ch8: Forms.</h1>
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>
                Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.
            </p>
            <h2>A Searching Example</h2>
            <section>
                <form name='search' action='/search'>
                    <input name='searchInput' placeholder="Search Here">
                    <button type='submit'>Search</button>
                </form>
            </section>
            <h2>Accesing Form Elements</h2>
            <p>
                <b>document.forms</b> will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>form.elements</b> will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.
            </p>
            <h2>Form Events</h2>
            <p>
                Forms have <b>focus</b>, <b>blur</b>, and <b>change</b> events that fire as a user interacts
                with the form.
            </p>
            <h2>Submitting a Form</h2>
            <p>
                Forms also have a <b>submit</b> event that can be used to intercept a form before it's been submitted.
            </p>
            <h2>Retrieving and Changing Values From a Form</h2>
            <p>
                The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the <b>value</b> property
                of the form controls.
            </p>
            <h2>Form Controls</h2>
            <p>
                Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some common types of form control are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>input</b> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads.</li>
                <li><b>select</b> menus for drop-down lists of options.</li>
                <li><b>textarea</b> elements for longer text entry.</li>
                <li><b>button</b> elements for submitting and resetting forms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Input Fields</h2>
            <p>
                HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.
            </p>
            <h2>Hero Form</h2>
            <section>
                <form id='heroForm'>
                    <label for='heroName'>Name:

            <h2>Form Validation</h2>
            <p>
                The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a
                basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Ch12: Object Oriented Programming.</h1>
            <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
            <p>
                Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that
                encapsulate their own properties and methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
            </p>
            <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
            <p>
                The inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential
                functionalities are exposed to the end user.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available
                to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it's done.
            </p>
            <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
            <p>
                The same process can be used for different objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability
                to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
            </p>
            <h2>Inheritance</h2>
            <p>
                Taking the features of one object then adding some new features.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties
                and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.
            </p>
            <h2>Classes</h2>
            <p>
                ES6 introduced class declarations that use the <b>class</b> keyword.
                These can be used in place of constructor functions.
            </p>
            <h2>Constructor Functions</h2>
            <p>
                Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keyword <b>this</b> refers to
                the object returned by the function.
            </p>
            <h2>Prototypal Inheritance</h2>
            <p>
                All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the
                properties and methods of its prototype.
            </p>
            <h2>Finding Out the Prototype</h2>
            <p>
                The prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object
                lacks a method, JavaScript will check whether its prototype has the method.
                If not, it will check that function's prototype until it finds the
                method or reaches the <b>Object</b> constructor function.
            </p>
            <h2>The Prototype Is Live!</h2>
            <p>
                The prototype is live, so new properties and methods can be added to
                existing instances.
            </p>
            <h2>Public and Private Methods</h2>
            <p>
                Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables using <b>const</b>
                and defining a function inside a constructor function. These can be made public
                using getter and setter functions.
            </p>
            <h2>Adding Methods to Built-in Objects</h2>
            <p>
                Monkey-patching is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by
                augmenting their prototypes. This should be done with caution as it can cause
                unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work.
            </p>
            <h2>Mixins</h2>
            <p>
                A mixin method can be used to add properties and methods from other objects
                without creating an inheritance chain.
            </p>
            <h2>Chaining Functions</h2>
            <p>
                Methods can be chained together and called in sequence if they return a reference to <b>this</b>.
            </p>
            <h2>Binding this, Use that = this and, bind(this)</h2>
            <p>
                The value of <b>this</b> is not retained inside nested functions, which can cause errors.
                This can be worked around by using <b>that = this</b>, using the <b>bind(this)</b> method
                and using arrow functions.
            </p>
            <h2>Borrowing Methods from Prototypes</h2>
            <p>
                Methods can be borrowed from other objects.
            </p>
            <h2>Composition Over Inheritance</h2>
            <p>
                Composition over inheritance is a design pattern where objects are composed from 'building-block'
                objects, rather than inheriting all their properties and methods from a parent class.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Ch15: Modern Javascript</h1>
            <h2>Libraries</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Libraries can make programming much easier, but you should think carefully about
                whether you require a library, and which one is best for your needs.
            </p>
            <h2>jQuery & Lodash</h2>
            <p>
                jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of
                useful and well-tested functions.
            </p>
            <h2>Modular JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and
                methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.
            </p>
            <h2>ES6 Modules</h2>
            <p>
                ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their
                own self-contained files and imported into another file.
            </p>
            <h2>MVC Frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that are
                responsible for different elements of an application.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Models</b> are objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading,
                        updating and deleting (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information
                        about the application, as well as any other associated logic and behavior.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Views</b> provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant
                        information. In a web application, this would be the HTML displayed on a
                        web page. Views also provide a way for users to interact with an application,
                        usually via forms.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Controllers</b> link models and views together by communicating between them.
                        They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user (entering some
                        data into a form, for example), process the information, then update the
                        model and view accordingly.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>A Quick List Example</h2>
            <section>
                <form id="input">
                    <label for='name'>Name:</label>
                    <input type='text' name='name' required >
                    <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
                </form>
                <ul id='list'></ul>
            </section>
            <h2>Templates</h2>
            <p>
                Template files can be used to separate view code from JavaScript; they
                also enable dynamic code and programming logic to be used to generate markup.
            </p>
            <h2>Web Components</h2>
            <p>
                The W3C are working on developing a standard called Web Components that attempts
                to extend HTML and introduce new features such as templates, custom tags, the
                ability to import HTML partials, and a shadow DOM. The idea is to use it to develop
                modular and self-contained components that can be reused in different applications.
            </p>
            <h2>View Libraries</h2>
            <p>
                React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components
                and keep track of their state.
            </p>
            <h2>Package Managers</h2>
            <p>
                npm and Yarn are package managers that can be used to install JavaScript
                packages, as well as any dependencies that they require.
            </p>
            <h2>Deploying JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
                Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified
                and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before the closing &lt/body&gt
                tag to ensure that all elements on the page have loaded before the script runs.

                in order to reduce its file size.

            <h2>Webpack</h2>
            <p>
                Webpack can be used to bundle multiple files into a single bundle, and
                automate common tasks such as transpiling, minifying code and running tests.
